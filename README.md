**Tank Mania: A Showcase of MVC Design Pattern in Game Development**

**"Tank Mania"** is an engaging tank simulation game developed as a personal project to demonstrate the practical application of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in game development. Utilizing Unity and leveraging free assets from Unity Learn, this project not only serves as a testament to my technical skills but also underscores my ability to implement complex software architecture in a game setting.

**Core Features:**
Diverse Tank Options: Players can choose from three distinct tanks, each featuring unique movement dynamics and rotation speeds, allowing for varied gameplay experiences.

MVC Architecture: The game's architecture is built on the MVC pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

Model: Manages the game data and rules, handling the properties of tanks, including speed and rotational dynamics.

View: Responsible for all the graphical representation of the game, ensuring the visuals accurately reflect the underlying models.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly.



This project is not just about the visual or conceptual appeal but is a focused endeavor to illustrate my proficiency with MVC design patterns in a real-world application. "Tank Mania" stands as a clear example of how foundational software design principles can be effectively utilized to enhance game development projects.
